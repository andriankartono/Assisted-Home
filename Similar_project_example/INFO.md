Found an almost similar project:

- LED lamp which can be controlled with button
- Web server reacting both to the physical intervention of a user acting directly on the circuit with a push button, but also remotely with a similar virtual device implemented in a web application.
- light can be switched on/off with button or Phone
- Web App always shows current state of lamp
